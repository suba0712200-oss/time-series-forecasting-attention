        "## 1. Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "Accurate time series forecasting is critical in domains such as energy demand planning, finance, and operations management. Traditional statistical models often struggle with complex temporal dependencies and multivariate interactions. Deep learning models such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks address these challenges by learning non-linear temporal patterns directly from data. In this project, an attention-based LSTM model is developed for multivariate time series forecasting and interpreted using Explainable AI (XAI) techniques to understand feature influence.\n",
